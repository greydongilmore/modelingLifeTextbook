## Chapter 1: Introduction to Discrete-Time Dynamical Systems
### 1.2 Variables, Parameters and Functions
- Variables: measurements that change over the course of experiment
- Parameters: remian constant during the experiment but can chnage between different experiments
- Functions: describe important relations between measurements, where value of one can be computed with value of other
- Independent variable (argument): input to a function 
- Dependent variable (value): output of a function 
- Domain: set of all possible things that a function can accept as input
- Co-domain: set of all possible things function can accept as output
- Range: all things function function does return as output
- A graph of a function is __not__ the function only a depication of the function
- __Vertical Line Test__: a relation is not a function if some vertical line crosses the graph two or more times
